    "In Python, an exception is an error that occurs during the execution of a program, disrupting the normal flow of code. When an exceptional situation arises, Python raises an exception, which can be caught and handled by the programmer. Exceptions provide a way to gracefully handle errors and prevent the program from crashing.\n",
    "\n",
    "In contrast, syntax errors are a type of error that occurs when the Python interpreter encounters invalid code syntax. These errors prevent the program from running at all and need to be fixed before the code can be executed. Syntax errors are typically caused by typos, missing colons, parentheses, incorrect indentation, or improper use of Python keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the main differences between exceptions and syntax errors in Python:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Occurrence:\n",
    "        Exceptions: Exceptions occur during the execution of the program when an unforeseen circumstance arises, such as division by zero, accessing an index out of range, or attempting to open a non-existent file.\n",
    "        Syntax Errors: Syntax errors occur before the program starts running and are detected by the Python interpreter when it tries to parse the code. These errors are typically due to mistakes in the code's structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Detection:\n",
    "        Exceptions: Exceptions are detected while the program is running, and Python automatically raises an exception when it encounters an error.\n",
    "        Syntax Errors: Syntax errors are detected before the program begins to run. The interpreter checks the code for correct syntax during the parsing phase and raises a syntax error if any issues are found.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Handling:\n",
    "        Exceptions: Exceptions can be caught and handled using try-except blocks. By handling exceptions, the program can gracefully recover from errors and continue executing the rest of the code without crashing.\n",
    "        Syntax Errors: Since syntax errors prevent the program from running, they need to be fixed in the code itself before the program can be executed."

    "#When an exception is not handled, it leads to what is commonly known as an \"unhandled exception.\" In programming, an exception is a signal that something unexpected or erroneous has occurred during the execution of a program. If this exception is not caught and handled properly by the program, it will propagate up the call stack until it reaches the top-level of the program or an operating system level, where it can lead to abnormal termination of the program.\n",

    "\n",
    "a. try and except:\n",
    "The try block is used to enclose the code that may potentially raise an exception. If an exception occurs within the try block, Python will look for a corresponding except block to handle the exception.\n",

    "\n",
    "b. finally:\n",
    "The finally block is used to define a set of actions that will be executed, regardless of whether an exception occurred or not. This block is typically used to perform cleanup operations or release resources.\n",

    "def read_file(filename):\n",
    "    try:\n",

    "Example:\n",
